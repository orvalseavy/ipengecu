                            <p> For those who haven't seen it yet, a tracklist for ELO's new album, Alone In The Universe , has been revealed on itunes. It hasn't been posted here yet, so I thought I might share it here for anyone interested. While technically not officially confirmed, the probability of this being legitimate is extremely high, as this is the tracklist that has been put on the website worldwide. The tracklist is as follows: Alone In The Universe When I Was A Boy (3:12) How exciting! By just a margin of 3 votes, 'Alone In The Universe' has defeated 'When I Was A Boy' to become the newest ELO Survivor! I really wasn't expecting this to happen; more often then not singles tend to win these, but I really am secretly pleased.

I've been meaning to ask this for a while and I thought this was a good time since some details on the new record leaked. I consider "Alone in the Universe" to be an ELO record. I've noticed that more than a few people on this subreddit would rather call it a Jeff Lynne solo album. I'm interested in what the general consensus is on here and why you classify this newer stuff the way you do. My reasoning is that I think Jeff Lynne has always been the heart and soul of ELO and that "Alone TL;DR: people who seek out knowledge on League often somehow know less about the game they’re playing. This is because they create expectations about how the game should be rather than how it is currently playing out. The result is an incited sense of panic, dread, and toxicity. Hi! It’s not really important to know who I am, save for the fact that I make a lot of ‘funny ha ha’ posts about League here and abroad. I’m about as involved in the community as any one person can be, except 
Hey so I’m relatively new to buying LPs, in that I can find them on eBay but really don’t know what other websites to look at. So I have all of ELO’s studio albums except Balance of Power, Alone in the Universe, and Zoom. Now the first two won’t be problems: there are a few BoPs on eBay and Alone in the Universe is just on Amazon. But Zoom, as far as I’ve seen, was only released on vinyl promotionally in 2013 from Let Them Eat Vinyl. Because of this, I’ve been having a hard time tracking Like the levels of heaven or hell, music fans battle who’s the bigger fan, the guy with the band logo tattooed on his forearm, the one who bought each album the week it hit the streets, the fan with the most torn ticket stubs, the one with the most band merch or the one who makes mixes and mashups of the band’s songs. The debate is endless. There isn’t a band I can claim to be the “ultimate fan”. There will always be someone out there who will be first in line, know more trivia or wants #Chapter 1 ##Demotion to irrelevant FC in GotG I was the main meat shield for Asher to smash during his ROIR crusade.
