 договор с дьяволом как заключить; лена сокол заставь меня влюбиться скачать книгу. I've been to the wiki that we are supposed to go to after we get ending E, but there's so much stuff there and I have a few questions that hopefully have simpler answers. Why did the Commander have us kill those three "thieves" in that one side-quest? What's the story there? Why did the machines in Pascal's town go mad, even though they were all disconnected from the network? amp#x200B; How do the aliens fit in with everything? Humanity was already extinct when they arrived Архитектура. LCL-CustomDrawn-Android использует маленькое Java приложение, которое сообщается с нашей Pascal библиотекой, отправляет FINAL WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD amp#x200B; I finished ending E just last night, and while a lot of things were cleared up, I'm still not sure I understand some things. amp#x200B; 1: From what I understand, a YoRHa android's body dies if their black box is destroyed, and their consciousness dies if their data is lost. Is there any reason all YoRHa androids don't have data backups? For instance, after the Simone boss fight, the YoRHa androids were found to be dead (no black box signals). · Это обзор проги Паскаль турбо на андроид. Pascal and his village = the innocent are punished. The Machine Network = the guilty go free. In other words, sometimes the guilty go free and the innocent are punished. If we expand on this we can look at the endings of other characters. The three androids are innocent going free, Emil is guilty being punished, and Devola amp Popola are innocent being punished, etc. If we view the game from a determinism perspective we can support the idea that things are predetermined without a plan. (I think this is where I should post this?) So I am thinking about writing a crossover with Nier: Automata, don't know if I'll actually do it yet. I played the game, got the main endings, watched videos on what I missed, and studied the lore (I did my homework, essentially) but I don't feel confident that I can accurately portray YoRHa, the machines, the other androids, or how they all would react to certain things, with what I know currently. I think I have a good idea of how they would 
Hi there, i recently finished Automata and was interested then to see what actually happened all the events before. I will wrote here my thoughts and want to hear from you about this. So, i did a quick review and watched cut scene's from Drakengard 1 and 3 and Nier. After all this i came to realized that this universe was from the beginning fucked up and doomed. First the dragon's and the flowers/song's whatever from the sisters which fate was the destruction of the world, and then Nier's I finished the game 4 days ago. I can't get it out of my head. Any1 got advice how to get over it? Last time I've felt this way was after I completed Life is Strange but this seems different. Who the hell is the mysterious tattooed Yorha soldier in the command room of the bunker ( SW corner immediately to your left as you enter on the upper floor)? She seems to know something. if not everything. She appears to be plotting with someone then snaps at you for eavesdropping. Or sometimes when you speak to her she'll say something kryptic about the war, before losing her cool and basically telling you to out of her face. She's one of the more interesting npcs. I am trying to understand the Machine Plan for Route C. It started so well but then it got so confusing, so if anyone could help with my doubts, that would be great:- Here is what happens in Route C FROM A MACHINE PERSPECTIVE STEPS- 1)Logic virus all Yorha ground troops by EMP amp use the back door to Bunker to infect the Bunker- great start 2)Almost all Yorha destroyed,bring out the Tower- so far so good 3)Work on creating a projectile(missile/space ship) aimed at the moon for 14 days(till. and i'm thinking shall i save? a scary music plays and he starts laughing.should i confirm it? thank. 
How does Pascal know how to create fuel filter for A2? It's a Yorha Android. Greetings, I just finished the game (all five endings ) and I've got a couple questions about it and some of the side materials I've been looking up. Before diving in I just wanted to say that is has been a absolutely innovative and expectacular experience. I'm glad that this entry has introduced me to Yoko Taro's works. And here for the questions: 1) Has the destruction of YoRHa and the Buker happened before? Is ending E the first in which the Pods didn't erase all Androids data? So, I kind of wanted to write this out to see if others thought similarly. While I've seen a lot of people try to grasp at straws to find a lot of context for the ending, it still feels to me like a lot needs to be assumed, like the original Nier game. Like, Yorha was created to constantly get better to fight the robots, hiding its true purpose to be destroyed to get better, but also to provide a purpose to the androids on earth through believing that the humans still lived. It seems I beat NieR a few months ago and decided to play through again (deleted my save for Ending E) to get the Platinum trophy. I've already read all the background stories as well as the supplemental texts on the wiki, including the stuff about Ending E, but I can't seem to find an explanation for why the machines turned into cannibals and started attacking Pascal's village. Was it ever explained anywhere? Another unrelated question: can the androids (non-YoRHa) reproduce? 
Personally I enjoyed ending D the most becasuse most of the machines/adroids emulated the worst aspects of humanity. There was an opportunity to improve upon the human condition and yet they fell into the same patterns, especially 9s. He is killed becasue he knows too much, which isnt unusual. If we know too much how long would it a take for a 3-letter organization to cause us to experience an "accidental suicide." Nothing tagic about that, what's tragic is that he doesnt learn. I just wanna see what you guys would like to be in the next Nier game, I don’t think this will be the last one. What I loved the most was the mechs and soundtrack , I hope they expand on it. However, I hope they ditch the black, white, and gray color scheme. it makes the game a little dull in terms of art imo. What about One thing I noticed on my recent playthrough is that Pascal basically just abandons you in the chapter "Lost Child". The big water boss shmup fight. He comes in dramatically at the last moment to offer 2B and 9S aid and then after the beast is defeated he just.wanders off while 2B and 9S might be dead and Adam was apparently dragging a bunch of Android corpses to the city? Can't really go back and check if there is some dialogue for this but it seems like it could be a plot hole. Or Pasca. </p>
