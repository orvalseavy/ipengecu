I have kind of a tough one today folks. I am trying to install Symantec Endpoint Encryption on a windows 7 pro PC. SEE says that it is not compatible with SCSI drives. Obviously SCSI drives are old af and we dont use them anymore. however, in msinfo32 I see that the drive of the workstation is labeled as a scsi drive. with the part number of the drive right there, I know for a fact it is a simple WD blue SATA drive. while I dont have access to the workstation right now, I can not check.

The problem here is that it's not very easy to do an in-place upgrade to a newer Windows 10 build because it will fail due to the encryption. Now I have to cretae custom install.wim files with some scripts from Symantec and create an upgrade TS. However, the problem is that a set of scripts will only work for a certain version of the SEE client, etc. Also, due to the pre-boot login screen of Symantec the user needs My older brother passed away yesterday morning, and I was given his Surface Pro 4. No one knows his password. I tried to use several USB boot programs to remove the password and none have worked. I am now stuck on a BitLocker screen asking for a recovery key.

My task sequence works great with no encryption (essentially following this ( I have also injected the PGP Driver filter into my boot image and have verified that I can access encrypted drives in WinPE. My systems Hi Sysadmin, I have been tasked to find a good full disk encryption product for laptops. In the past I have used the Symantec product as well as TruCrypt, but was wondering what other products you guys would say you love and others you hated. Thanks in advance. Dear r/techsupport, Would you mind helping me find the appropriate encryption software I need for school? I always find myself looking to reddit for wonderful guidance. This is my dilemma. In order to comply with the school's policy, I need to perform a whole disk encryption on my laptop to protect medical records, etc. Unfortunately, my OS is Windows 8.1 Standard and I do not have a TPM chip . I only need whole disk encryption because my school requires it for admittance. Why or why not? What products are you using? Do you do it and what do you use? We buy Dell laptops with hardware FDE spinning disks, we're interested in moving to SSD but they are fucking us over on price so we're looking at software options. We buy Windows OEM and don't buy SA on it so Bitlocker is out. What other options have people had success with? Truecrypt is the obvious choice so I'm interested to hear from you if you've used that in a corporate setting, but beyond Truecrypt nothing seems to jump out as the "go to" choice. 
When a client conducts business with your company, they entrust their personal information and credentials to you for safekeeping.

The escalating cases of wide scale ransomware attacks worldwide have only served to highlight the importance of finding different ways to keep your customer’s data in safe hands. Australian. Where I work (Higher Ed), there has been debate on how to secure mass storage devices like USB flash drives and external hard drives. We've evaluated options such as disabling mass storage devices, making them all read-only, allowing only hardware encrypted devices like IronKey, and/or requiring encryption software like BitLockerToGo, McAfee FME, Symantec RME, etc. I am curious, how does your place of employment handle mass storage devices, if at all and what would you prefer. 27th February 2019 \- The global Data-Loss Prevention (DLP) Market (https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/data-loss-prevention-dlp-market?utm_source=Redditamputm_medium=Referralamputm_campaign=Nikhilk_27Feb19) is expected to display higher growth rate over the next five years.

As above, we have full drive encryption through symantec endpoint encryption on our laptops, and then windows 10 feature updates completely fail if the drive is encrypted. Its going to fail, really. But I cant think of a way around this for patching, at the moment were having to manually decrypt the drive and then target the policy afterwards? Anyone know if moving to bit locker is a way around this? Thanks. The code warrior and robocoder ArqTras and Michal M@lbit have been adding more code to ArQmA. Along with performance enhancements there is a specific focus on internal tamper proofing and security features. The test net is up for the next fork patches as they are integrated. ArqTras, said thus: 1. db\_lmdb: enable batch transactions by default 2. add --regtest and --fixed-difficulty for regression testing 3. update get\_info RPC and bump RPC version 4. alt\_chain\_info I have a hard drive that is encrypted by Symantec Endpoint Whole Drive Encryption. How the encryption works normally is when I boot up, before getting to a Windows environment I am prompted by Symantec to enter creditials to access the hard drive and then everything boots like normal. Well I dropped the laptop and now after I enter my credentials it trys to boot windows then blue screens. If I put the hard drive in another computer to try to recover from it, Windows cant access the drive becaus. Hello All, Many people ask me: "I know Macs are safer than most PCs, but what extra steps can I take to ensure I am secure both online, and off?". Throughout the years, in part thanks to some paranoia, I have collected a few practices that I think most people should follow. Also, being the holiday season, I'm assuming many people might have gotten new Macs, so this is a good time to go through this. It is my hope that by following some, or all of these points, you can feel a bit more safe while. I'm trying to figure out the best way to move 150+ remote work-from-home systems to Windows 10 Enterprise when the time comes. Is mailing out a near zero-touch MDT USB media drive install reasonable? We have no in-house desktop support and I really want to avoid configuring and cross-shipping replacement systems. We do have a MSP for desktop support stuff, but I don't want to put this on them. Additional info; all systems are Dell Latitude class laptops running Windows 7 Pro along with Symante. </p>
