Hello, I've made a video player which works on linux with NET core and electron. However the problem I have is HTML5 video player supports only few formats, so I've used ffmpeg to convert videos to valid formats. and this takes time. I'm trying, but failing, to find a proper way to either decode videos on the fly OR use some sort of video player which I could control using interop. I'm using electron to show page which plays videos, as well as having a video player UI (there's more stuff. My blu ray (Samsung) is connected by ethernet to my home network. I can access windows computers from it, but I've never done anything like this for a Linux box. I assume it can be done,but I'm just not sure what the Linux equivalent of "network sharing" would be. Definitely not new to Linux, but haven't had the time to dive into the networking side much yet. if somebody can just point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it :) edit: got it working with MiniDLNA. I have Ubuntu OS on my computer and would like to stream 180 degree VR movies from my computer to my Oculus Go (on its way from Amazon). Skybox is Win/Mac only for now. Any other good options for us Linux users. Hi all, I’ve been debating on whether or not to use Linux for a while. A little bit ago (about 4 or so months) I actually switched to Ubuntu and I loved it. Tweaked it to my hearts content and all that. The main reason I unfortunately had to switch back to windows was compatibility with some applications (iTunes, Origin, a few others) and certain drivers not working, like one for my HP printer at home. I have a laptop, and I’m planning on going back to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. any tips I should. Hello, As the title says, I cannot get VLC to show up on video players list in PT, Linux Ubuntu 18.04. Currently using the version 0.3.10 (from popcorntime.sh) for Linux Ubuntu 64-bit. VLC itself is installed and works fine. amp#x200B. 
Hi, Are there any VR video player for linux? ~~(my crystal ball predicts some downvotes just because there is "linux" on the title :D)~~ Actually not, thanks I read the doc for VLC but with vdpau it does not support h.265. My windows laptop is dying a bit and I was tossing around the idea of picking up a ChromeBox. I was eyeing the cheapest Asus ChromeBox 3. I'm a bit hesitant because I'm not sure it's the right choice for me, and would like some advice. Things I mainly use my laptop for: - It's always at my desk hooked up to an additional monitor and full keyboard.hence why I'm interested in a Box and not a Book. - Torrents! I have my computer on all the time with uTorrent running, grabbing stuff autom. 
Are there cracked games available for linux? I switched to linux (ubuntu) last year and now I cant tolerate windows but i wanna game too on my machine. (yes i know about steam but i wanna know if its possible to get cracked games). For software that costs money, I understand why people would want to start from scratch and make their own software: They want money for themselves instead of contributing to something where other people get the money. But in the Linux world, software is usually free, yet there are lots of programs that barely differ for most common tasks. I thought making something open source would mean that people contribute to existing projects more instead of starting new over and over again. Especially. </p>
